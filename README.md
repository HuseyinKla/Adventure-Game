# Adventure-Game

We have 3 different regions in this adventure game. Every environment has its own barriers. These obstacles force the user to get the special stone of each region. That is, the player first overcomes the obstacles and then accesses the special element. After gaining access to the special element in each region, the game is complete.

In addition to these, we can play with 3 different heroes. And besides this hero we choose, we can buy equipment from the points we earn as we defeat the obstacles. We can overcome obstacles faster by getting stronger.

There is also a section on how to play the game :)
